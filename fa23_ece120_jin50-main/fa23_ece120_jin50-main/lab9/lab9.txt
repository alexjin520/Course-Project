QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab9.bin.)

ANSWER: The program first clears the value of R2, and it then adds the decimal value of 12 to R2 and stores the result in R2


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: Step helps us check each step in a much easier way. If we find bugs by checking the program without any tools, it is very hard and time-consuming. With the function of step, we could find the error and stop. Therefore, finding bugs becomes quicker.
